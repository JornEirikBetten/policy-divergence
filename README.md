# policy-divergence
This repository contains scripts and codes used to generate the work "Stochastic Sources of Divergence in Reinforcement Learning".  The work examines how RL policies diverge based on how the randomness in which scenarios are sampled from the environment, and in the network parameter initialization diverge RL policies.
